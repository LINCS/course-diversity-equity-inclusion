  <name>Unit 2 Awareness Building: Understanding Adult Learners </name>
  <summary>&lt;p&gt;This unit will provide tools and information used to identify student demographics. By the end of this section, you will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Identify the demographics of the population served in your program using multiple data tools (e.g., demographic trends in your area, National Reporting System (NRS) data to see who is attending now and who has attended in the past, Program for the International Assessment for Adult Competencies (PIAAC) literacy levels in your community).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Investigate the demographics of the population served in their program and in your local community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Recognize the importance of identifying the literacy and numeracy levels in your local community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Demonstrate ability to determine if their program population is reflective of the community served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articulate an action step toward meeting the needs of the student population or community served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have completed the activities in this section, return to the main course page to begin Unit 3, “Awareness Building: Cultural Competence and Inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
